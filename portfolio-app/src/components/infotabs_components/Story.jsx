        <p>I started my journey in web development by creating websites on uCoz back in 2011. In 2014, I started learning PHP and creating simple mobile websites. Later on, I grew tired of it and in 2016, I began making bots for VK. After realizing that the bot platform was not suitable, I switched to Telegram in 2017.</p>
        <p>I have been following the gaming industry since childhood, but unfortunately, there weren't many opportunities to play games back then. That's why my first console was the PS4.</p>
